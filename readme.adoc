*Structure*

The game is just one single class that contains all the attributes and methods of the game.

*About this version*

Although the game is playable and you can complete a match there are some things wrong:

* There is no trying limit, when it should be 10.
* The structure of just one class is not the suitable because it is hard to read and understand the whole game. It should be done with more classes that interact with each others.
* The game does not show the precious combinations in the window, it just shows the last combination.
* There should be some kind of replayability

=== Version 1.1.0

The game is still playable and new functionalities have been added:

* Now there is a limit of guesses, 10.
* There is an Introduction to the game that presents and explains the game.
* The structure is now divided in clases after *abstracting* the stuff related and creating new classes.
* The game also shows the user the previous guesses.

*About this version*

The structure seems better but still has some problems.

* The class colour was done but never used. *YAGNI*
* The game still lacks replayability
* The structure could be done much better.
