*About this version*

Although the game is playable and you can complete a match there are some things wrong:

* There is no trying limit, when it should be 10.
* The structure of just one class is not the suitable because it is hard to read and understand the whole game. It should be done with more classes that interact with each others.
* The game does not show the precious combinations in the window, it just shows the last combination.
* There should be some kind of replayability
